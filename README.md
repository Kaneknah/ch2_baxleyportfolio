# Code Refactor Starter C# <ch2_baxleyportfolio>

## Description

This project is a portfolio webpage(https://kaneknah.github.io/ch2_baxleyportfolio/) designed to display other projects. The webpage is static in that it does not contain Java Script but should function as a foundation for navigating to alternative gitHub and project locations.
The purpose of this project was to perform a summative assessment of my HTML and CSS skills thus far and obtain an understanding of my abilities to write these codes from scratch. The webpage itself incorporates the following aspects learned so far in bootcamp.

HTML
General Layout
descriptive Sections
organization of information

CSS
Responsive Layout
FlexBox
hover affects
general CSS styling aspects
linking outside webpages to project

the most challenging aspect of this project was learning how to use and manipulate FlexBox aspects to organize the layout of the page in a unique and ascetically appeasing manner. The utilization of @media responsive design was also difficult to manipulate fot this project.
