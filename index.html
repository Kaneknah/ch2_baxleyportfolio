            "It is not the critic who counts;
            not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
            or where the doer of deeds
            could have done them better.
            The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
            whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
            who errs, who comes short again and again..."

                    <p>I am a former High School teacher who has recently transitioned to web design. Born and raised in
                        San Diego,
                        I attended San Diego State University for my BA in History. I also acquired a Masters in
                        Education from
                        Azusa Pacific University and a Clear Teaching Credential from University of California San
                        Diego. I have
                        been in the Educational Field in California and Montana for over 12 years, before I decided to
                        change
                        directions and pursue a career in web design.<br> <br> I have(will soon) completed the Berkely
