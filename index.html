        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/holder.bmp" alt="temporary image of me as a baby" class="float-left" />
        <p>I am a former High School teacher who has recently transitioned to web design. Born and raised in San Diego,
            I attended San Diego State University for my BA in History. I also aquired a Masters in Education from
            Azusa Pacific University and a Clear Teaching Credential from University of California San Diego. I have
            been in the Educational Field in California and Montana for over 12 years, before I decided to change
            directions and pursue a career in web design.<br> <br> I have(will soon) completed the Berkely Bootcamp in
            Full
            Stack
            Web Development in April and have provided several examples of my completed projects through that course. I
            have also provided some of my own projects
            that I have compelted on my own. I curently live outside of Missoula Montana with my beautiful wife and my
            three daughters and
            son. I am very excited to combined my professional knowledge with my newly learned skills to dive into an
            engaging carrer in web design.

            "...If you can fill
            the unforgiving minute
            With sixty seconds’
            worth of distance run,
            Yours is the Earth
            and everything that’s in it,
            And—which is more
            you’ll be a Man, my son!"<br>
